            I am a huge sports fan.  I have always loved the Steelers but have
            also recently began to love watching the NBA as well.  My favorite
            team to watch is the Golden State Warriors.  I also love playing
            video games on my Xbox One.  My favorite game is Call of Duty.  I
            also like to just go hang out with my friends at a bar on weekends.
