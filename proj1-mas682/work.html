            <p>
            I have worked in restaurants ever since high school.  I started out
            by jumping from resturant to restaurnt, but the past few years, I
            have been working at Hyde Park Steakhouse on the north shore.  I
            have not had any CS related jobs while in college, but am hopeful to
            get an internship in the upcoming fall.
