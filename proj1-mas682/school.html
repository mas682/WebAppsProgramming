            <p>
            I am currently a senior.  I have only 2 classes left to take after
            the summer, with a internship being one of them.  I actually started
             college by going to Community College of Allegheny County but have
            completed the past 5 semesters at Pitt. I curretly have experience
            coding in Java, C, and Ruby but am curretly learning Python as well.
            I am not really sure what field of computer science I want to get
            into after school, but I am hoping to find something within
            Pittsburgh as I was born and raised here.
